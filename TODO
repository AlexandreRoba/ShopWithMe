1) I still need to modify the delete a little bit further: I need to search for the shopping list id in all accounts
 and then remove it from all accounts

2) Account Search and delete: GET, DELETE -> /profiles/:username should only work
 for the current user , otherwise return 403 FORBIDDEN
	
2) Solve the problem about sharing with persons not yet registered: invitees
  contains ObjectIds and for these users we still do not have them as they are not
  yet registered! Maybe I could put the username into invitees and the username 
  could be the same as the one chosen in Facebook... think about it!
