1) Modify GET shopping list method to use the new securityPolicy object (see update list)

2) Refactor route DEL  as per http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/creating-truly-res-tful-apis and
make it invoke the AccountRepository method that removes the list id from the collection of shopping lists of the user

3) Account Search and delete: GET, DELETE -> /profiles/:username should only work
 for the current user , otherwise return 403 FORBIDDEN
	
4) Solve the problem about sharing with persons not yet registered: invitees
  contains ObjectIds and for these users we still do not have them as they are not
  yet registered! Maybe I could put the username into invitees and the username 
  could be the same as the one chosen in Facebook... think abou it!
