- Modify the delete shopping list function: search for the shopping list id in all accounts
 and then remove it from all accounts --> looks like an heavy computation, it should probably be rethinked

- Create a Shopping List Item Schema like
var UserSchema = new Mongoose.Schema({

    username: {
        type: String,
        index: { unique: true, sparse: true },
        required: true, lowercase: true, trim: true
    },

    email: {
        type: String,
        index: { unique: true, sparse: true },
        required: true, lowercase: true, trim: true
    },

    contacts: [ContactSchema]

});

var ContactSchema = new Mongoose.Schema({

    user: {
        ref: "User",
        type: Mongoose.Schema.ObjectId
    },

    isContact: {
        type: Boolean,
        default: true
    }

});

- Modify test/Routes.js to add a after() method to cleanup db and close connection mongodb

- Account Search and delete: GET, DELETE -> /profiles/:username should only work
 for the current user , otherwise return 403 FORBIDDEN
	
- Solve the problem about sharing with persons not yet registered: invitees
  contains ObjectIds and for these users we still do not have them as they are not
  yet registered! Maybe I could put the username into invitees and the username 
  could be the same as the one chosen in Facebook... think about it!
