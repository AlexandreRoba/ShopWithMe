- Modify the delete shopping list function: search for the shopping list id in all accounts
 and then remove it from all accounts --> looks like an heavy computation, it should probably be rethinked

- Search friends should not be an API level function. The Android application will
  query the Facebook API using the cached access token. The API should offer a function to share a list, that
  accepts facebook friends user ids as input.
  If these user ids are not yet registered, then I can create a collection that stores documents such as:
  { $facebookUserId: [list of shared list ids] }
  Each time a user is created, we check this collection and we add the list ids into the shoppingLists array of the account.

- How do I keep track of users a list has been shared with, who are not on ShopWithMe yet? I mean, when I fetch
  a shopping list, this user's id won't be into the invitees array because the account has not yet been created!
  Solve the problem about sharing with persons not yet registered: invitees
  contains ObjectIds and for these users we still do not have them as they are not
  yet registered! Maybe I could put the facebook user id into invitees and each time I fetch a list, the client has
  the responsibility to query Facebook for resolving these user ids into name, last name and the profile pic.
  Does Facebook has an API endpoint that given a user id gives back those info?

- Modify test/Routes.js to add a after() method to cleanup db and close connection mongodb

- Account Search and delete: GET, DELETE -> /profiles/:username should only work
 for the current user , otherwise return 403 FORBIDDEN

- Secure each API endpoint so that we check for the API ACCESS TOKEN that is valid, and that the user id related to the
  token is the same user id contained in the URL. Otherwise return 403 FORBIDDEN
